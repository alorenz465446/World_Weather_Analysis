# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

Help improve the PlanMyTrip app by using OpenWeather API and Google Maps API to add weather description to already retrieved data. Also allowing beta testers to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Beta testers will be able to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. After I will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Examples
